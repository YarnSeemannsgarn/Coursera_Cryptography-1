"""
The numbers 7 and 23 are relatively prime and therefore there must exist integers a and b such that 7a+23b=1. Find such a pair of integers (a,b) with the smallest possible a>0. Given this pair, can you determine the inverse of 7 in Z23? 

Enter below comma separated values for a, b, and for 7âˆ’1 in Z23.

Solution:
Use extended euclid to find a and b and inverse of 7
